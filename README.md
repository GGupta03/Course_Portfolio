## 🏆 Achievements & Highlights

### 🧩 Project: **Hybrid Customer Churn Prediction using NLP and Machine Learning**

**Abstract:**  
Customer churn represents a significant financial challenge for the telecommunications industry.  
This project proposes a **hybrid ensemble model** that integrates **structured customer data** and **unstructured feedback text** for better churn prediction accuracy.  

The system combines:
- **XGBoost / Logistic Regression** for structured behavioral data.  
- **DistilBERT NLP model** fine-tuned on complaint text for sentiment-driven churn risk detection.  

By averaging both model outputs, the system produces a unified churn score, enabling **targeted retention strategies** that address both behavioral and emotional customer signals.
